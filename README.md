# Wool & Wood API
The API that will drive the Wool &amp; Wood Online Store, and to be used a basis for my own API standards.
Built for a client, an API will enable them to change the frontend as they see fit, in case that the developed 
solution is not fit for their needs.

## Tools and Frameworks
This API is built with Node.js 16 [], a MongoDB database [] and Express.js [] as the primary tools. 

### Goals and Improvements to self

difficulties in developing an API

#### Goals
- Develop a complete API, with best practises applied
- Have a minimum of 70% test coverage
- Understand how payment API's work
- Develop understanding of NoSQL databases

#### Potential Challenges
